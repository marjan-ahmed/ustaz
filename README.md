## Features

### GitHub Projects Discovery
This application includes a feature to discover open-source Python projects on GitHub that are accepting new contributors. Visit `/github-projects` to:
- Find Python repositories with over 100 stars
- Filter for projects with "good first issue" or "help wanted" labels
- Browse projects in a responsive, user-friendly interface

## Development

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
