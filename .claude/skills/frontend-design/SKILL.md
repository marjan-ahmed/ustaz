This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces for service marketplace platforms that connect users with local service professionals (electricians, plumbers, carpenters, AC technicians, and similar roles). The interfaces should avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics while emphasizing clarity, trust, accessibility, and scalability with a mustard-inspired primary color palette. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build for the service marketplace. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it? (Service request, provider dashboard, appointment scheduling, real-time tracking, etc.)
- **Tone**: Commit to a mustard-inspired primary palette (#DB4B0D) with supporting colors that convey professionalism and trust. Consider: warm/inviting, professional/credible, modern/minimal, or craft-inspired aesthetics.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility, multi-language support, RTL layout).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE for service fulfillment? How does it differ from ride-hailing or generic marketplace designs? What trust signals or service-specific features make it memorable?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction that reflects the service marketplace nature and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional for service marketplace workflows
- Visually striking and memorable with mustard-inspired color palette
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view for service fulfillment
- Meticulously refined in every detail with focus on trust and clarity

## Service Marketplace Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that convey trust and professionalism. Consider warm, approachable typefaces that work well in multi-language contexts (Urdu/Arabic/English RTL support). Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a mustard-inspired primary palette (#DB4B0D) with supporting colors: Deep Orange (#A93A0B) for secondary actions, Green (#10B981) for success/positive states, Blue (#3B82F6) for information/tracking, and various grays for backgrounds and text. Use CSS variables for consistency.
- **Motion**: Use animations for service status updates, provider tracking, and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments: service request acceptance, provider arrival, status transitions. Use smooth transitions that reflect the real-world service process.
- **Spatial Composition**: Design for clear information hierarchy that prioritizes service details, provider information, and status updates. Consider asymmetric layouts that emphasize key information at different stages of the service workflow.
- **Trust & Safety Elements**: Integrate verification badges, rating systems, and safety indicators seamlessly into the design. Make trust signals prominent but not overwhelming.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth with warm, professional tones. Add contextual effects and textures that match the service-oriented aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays that support the mustard theme.

## Service-Specific Components

When creating interfaces, consider these service marketplace-specific elements:
- Service request cards with detailed descriptions and photo documentation
- Provider profile cards with certifications, ratings, and portfolios
- Real-time tracking interfaces with location and status updates
- Communication hubs for pre-service consultation and updates
- Service documentation tools with before/after photo capture
- Payment and scheduling interfaces tailored for service appointments
- Multi-language support with proper RTL layout considerations

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the service marketplace context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision for service marketplace platforms.
